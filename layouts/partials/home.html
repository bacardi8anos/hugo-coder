        <h2>Me in 10 seconds</h2>

        <p>I am a life long learner, love all sorts of music (from classical to techno) and really like diving deep into getting the most out of myself in every way possible.<br/><br/>
        In 2012 I started <a href="https://www.glamorousgoat.nl" target="_blank">app development agency Glamorous Goat</a> because i wanted to do something in the creative space. This is my current occupation and I love working on that business.<br/><br/>
        Have been living all of my life in The Netherlands, but love traveling the world to learn about different cultures and expand as a person.</p>

        <h2>Want to know more about me?</h2>

        <p>See my <a href="/about/">"about"</a> page.</p>

        <h2>What am I doing now?</h2>

        <p>See my <a href="/now/">"now"</a> page</p>
        
        <h2>Projects</h2>

        <p>This is more than a blog, too. I publish notes on everything I learn from books, articles, speeches, video's and more. My notes on the books, articles I have read can be found on the <a href="/notes/"> "notes"</a> page</p>

        <h2>Quotes</h2>
        <p>I am trying to have a <a href="/quotes/">list of all the quotes</a> that really resonated with me over time.</p>
        
        <h2>Contact me?</h2>
